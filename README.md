# Decision Tree for Classification
A simple program for creating and pruning a decision tree in R. The data used is from a cardiotocographic dataset. 
The program is a very simple one, and needs a lot more work to be done on it to bring it to a state where it can display more statistical summaries and give better estimates on what the appropriate tree size is.
